\begin{abstract}
The Internet of things is foreseen as one of the next imminent Internet revolutions, as many devices will seamlessly communicate together to provide new and exciting services to the end users. One of the challenges that the IoT has to face is about both the heterogeneity of the available data and the heterogeneity of the communication. In this paper we focus on the former, by presenting an architecture able to integrate data coming from different sources, including custom made deployments and governmental data, and deliver new services made by the end users.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we showed how open data express their high potential in the ecosystem of data fusion and how we aim to manage them in order to integrate heterogeneous collaborative approaches within a global vision, by exploiting heterogeneous data sources.
