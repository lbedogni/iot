@inproceedings{Bedogni2012,
abstract = {Nowadays, the increasing popularity of smartphone devices equipped with multiple sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gy- roscope, etc) have opened several possibilities to the deployment of novel and exciting context-aware mobile applications. In this paper, we exploit one of this possibility, by investigating how to detect the user motion type through sensors data collected by a smartphone. Our study combines experimental and analytical contributions, and it is structured in three parts. First, we collected experimental data that demonstrate the existence of specific sensors data patterns associated to each motion type, and we propose methods for data analysis and features extraction. Second, we compare the performance of different supervised algorithms for motion type classification, and we demonstrate that jointly utilizing the multiple sensor inputs of a smartphone (i.e. the accelerometer and the gyroscope) can significantly improve the accuracy of the classifiers. At the same time, we analyze the impact of sampling parameters (e.g. the sampling rate) on the system performance, and the corresponding trade- off between classification accuracy and energy consumption of the device. Third, we integrate the motion type recognition algorithm into an Android application, that allows to associate a specific smartphone configuration to each detected motion type, and to provide this information at system-level to other context- aware Android applications. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our application in detecting the user's motion type with high accuracy, and in mitigating the classification errors caused by random data fluctuations.},

@inproceedings{Mirri2014,
abstract = {âThis work presents a novel geospatial mapping service, based on OpenStreetMap, which has been designed and developed in order to provide personalized path to users with special needs. This system gathers data related to barriers and facilities of the urban environment via crowdsourcing and sensing done by users. It also considers open data provided by bus operating companies to identify the actual accessibility feature and the real time of arrival at the stops of the buses. The resulting service supports citizens with reduced mobility (users with disabilities and/or elderly people) suggesting urban paths accessible to them and providing information related to travelling time, which are tailored to their abilities to move and to the bus arrival time. The manuscript demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach by means of a case study focusing on the differences between the solutions provided by our system and the ones computed by main stream geospatial mapping services.},

@inproceedings{Guo2014,
abstract = {The research on the efforts of combining human and machine intelligence has a long history. With the development of mobile sensing and mobile Internet techniques, a new sensing paradigm called Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), which leverages the power of citizens for large-scale sensing has become popular in recent years. As an evolution of participatory sensing, MCS has two unique features: (1) it involves both implicit and explicit participation; (2) MCS collects data from two user-participant data sources: mobile social networks and mobile sensing. This paper presents the literary history of MCS and its unique issues. A reference framework for MCS systems is also proposed. We further clarify the potential fusion of human and machine intelligence in MCS. Finally, we discuss the future research trends as well as our efforts to MCS.},
